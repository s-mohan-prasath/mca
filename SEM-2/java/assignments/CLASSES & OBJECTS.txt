4.

Yes, the static method can be called from a constructor. A Constructor is nothing but a function called during instantiation, similar to the other non-static functions. Non-static member functions can access static members.

5. Why is there no return type for the Constructor?

Constructors Are Not Called Explicitly
A constructor is invoked automatically when an object is created using new keyword.
Since Java automatically manages constructor invocation, there is no need for a return type.
